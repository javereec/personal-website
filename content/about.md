# Welcome to My Personal Space

Hi, I'm Jan and welcome to my personal space on the web! My life revolves around three core pillars: my family, my health, and my passion for work. These priorities guide everything I do and shape the person I am today. Beyond my professional interests, I'm an avid reader with a thirst for knowledge. In my leisure time, you’ll often find me lost in the world of games, in my garden, or enjoying fine (Italian) wine and food. I also cherish moments spent flâneuring, exploring the world at my own pace and soaking in new experiences. This blend of personal and professional interests defines me and fuels my approach to the challenges and opportunities presented to me.

### Through Innovation  
Participating in cutting-edge working groups such as OIDF's Gain POC Community Group and Digital Credential Working Group, helping shape the future of digital credentials.
