My name is Jan Vereecken. I build products in the domain of digital identity, credentials and trust. I use deep technical expertise in related identity standards, some of which I actively contribute to, to solve problems by turning them into practical solutions. Currently, I lead product strategy and execution as Chief Product Officer at Meeco.

Outside of work, Iâ€™m passionate about traveling, nature, wine, movies, reading, gaming, weightlifting, gardening, and walking my dog. I live with my family in Flanders, Belgium.

Opinions expressed here are my own.
